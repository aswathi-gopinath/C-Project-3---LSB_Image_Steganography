# C-Project-3---LSB_Image_Steganography
his project implements LSB (Least Significant Bit) Image Steganography to hide text messages inside .bmp images. Unlike cryptography, it conceals the message itself. Users can embed messages, optionally add a magic string to identify steged images, and decrypt hidden messages via a simple command-line application.
